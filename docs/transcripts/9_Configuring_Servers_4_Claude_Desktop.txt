0:02 The MCP server you built and the reference servers you used
0:05 can also be used with any other MCP compliant application.
0:10 That could be an IDE for a desktop app or an agentic framework.
0:14 Claude desktop is an example of such an application.
0:17 In this lesson,
0:18 you'll learn how to configure Claude Desktop to connect to MCP servers.
0:22 Let's have some fun!
0:23 So you previously seen how to build your own MCP servers and clients and use
0:28 prompts, resources and tools to build pretty sophisticated applications.
0:32 And I mentioned that some of that code, particularly when building
0:35 clients and multiple clients, can be a bit low level.
0:38 What you're going to see is the ability to use applications like Claude desktop
0:42 and a variety of other agentic products, to use MCP to connect to MCP servers
0:48 and abstract away some of the challenges of that lower-level coding.
0:51 Right here I'm in a folder called MCP project on the desktop,
0:54 and I have the research server that you made in a previous lesson.
0:57 What I'm going to do now is follow the same steps to create
1:01 an environment with uv and install the necessary dependencies.
1:04 And then I'm going to navigate to Claude Desktop and bring in this MCP
1:08 server alongside a couple other other reference servers that we've seen.
1:12 So we'll start by doing uv init.
1:13 I'll make sure to uv venv and I'll activate my virtual environment.
1:17 I'll install the necessary dependencies that we have.
1:20 So I'll go ahead and add arxiv as well as MCP.
1:24 Once I've
1:24 got these added, I have all of the necessary dependencies
1:28 that I need to start my server, but I'm not going to run the server here.
1:32 I'm going to use Claude Desktop to do that for me.
1:35 The same way that we set up our own Json file for configuring
1:38 how to connect to MCP servers,
1:40 we're going to do something similar with Claude Desktop. In Claude Desktop,
1:43 I'll head over to settings.
1:46 I'll go to developer.
1:48 And we can see here
1:49 that I can edit a config file to start connecting to MCP servers.
1:53 I'm going to go ahead and open up this JSON file.
1:56 And inside here, I'm going to paste in our configuration
1:59 file from before, but with a slight change.
2:02 We're still referencing the name of the server and the command necessary
2:06 to get the server started.
2:07 What's important though, is that for our research server, I'm
2:11 specifying the exact file path to go ahead and run the server.
2:20 If you
2:21 remember, when using standard IO and connecting locally,
2:24 the client is going to start a connection and a subprocess to these servers.
2:28 With this file and the Claude desktop AI application.
2:32 This is all abstracted away from us.
2:34 So all of that lower-level code that we were doing earlier
2:37 we don't need to worry about.
2:38 It's important to know how it works under the hood.
2:40 But what we're doing here is that same idea
2:43 multiple clients connecting to multiple servers.
2:46 But all we need is the configuration file.
2:48 You're also going to see in Claude desktop, what the interface looks like
2:52 when working with prompts and tools and resources.
2:55 Once we've modified this file, we have to close Claude desktop
2:58 and reopen it so we can establish these connections.
3:01 Now that I've restarted Claude Desktop, I can take a look at some of the tools
3:05 I have access to.
3:06 And we saw this before when exploring SQLite 3.
3:09 I have my local research server with the tools that we've defined.
3:13 I have my fetch and file system and I have from the research server
3:18 my resource as well as my prompts. The interface for prompts and resources
3:22 and tools is completely up to the developer of a tool like Claude Desktop.
3:27 There are a variety of AI assistants and tools
3:30 and agentic products that you can use that support the Model Context Protocol.
3:34 Let's examine those. Over here on the Model Context Protocol documentation,
3:38 we can see a list of applications that support MCP integrations.
3:42 And a lot of this should look relatively familiar.
3:44 These are some of the primitives we've explored,
3:46 like resources, prompts, and tools.
3:48 And in the last section,
3:49 you'll learn a bit about sampling and routes other powerful primitives
3:53 that are on their way to getting more and more adoption.
3:55 As you can see here, there's quite a range of applications
3:58 from web applications, agentic applications, command line interfaces,
4:02 integrated development environments that support the model Context Protocol.
4:06 You can click on any of these, discover them, and see
4:09 how to start talking to MCP servers within these existing applications.
4:13 What's so powerful about this idea
4:15 is that while this may look extremely vast,
4:17 you've actually seen already how a lot of this works under the hood
4:20 by building your own servers and own clients.
4:23 So let's take a look at how Claude desktop users are
4:26 tools, prompts, and resources by connecting to MCP servers.
4:30 Now let's put this all together.
4:31 I'm going to paste in a prompt that I have here to use the fetch tool
4:35 to visit DeepLearning.AI
4:36 I can find an interesting topic about machine learning.
4:39 I'll then use our research server to research a few papers
4:43 and summarize the main topics covered.
4:45 I'll then use the artifacts feature to generate a web-based quiz
4:48 application with a set of flashcards based on the key topics in the papers.
4:52 So what we're doing here is combining a set of tools
4:55 from different MCP servers to fetch the data that we're looking for.
5:00 So we're using the fetch tool here to visit DeepLearning.AI.
5:03 And here, looks like there are quite a few interesting topics.
5:06 One of those being multi-modal LLMs and advancements in AI models.
5:10 We'll then use our search papers tool from the research server
5:14 to extract some information about those papers.
5:16 We'll even look at one more recent paper to ensure we have a good sample.
5:24 Here, we see the two papers that have been discovered
5:26 and a web application that's being built at the moment.
5:29 The ability to incorporate visualizations and tools like artifacts
5:33 with the tools that we get from MCP servers, allow us to build really powerful
5:37 applications across a variety of domains with relative ease.
5:41 While we just have a small example here, you can let your imagination
5:43 carry you again for all the different use cases we have.
5:47 We've got a summarization and a little game right here.
5:49 We can take a look at what some of these answers are.
5:51 And with a little bit of prompting,
5:52 we can always make this look a little bit nicer.
5:55 In this lesson, you've seen how to use tools like Claude Desktop
5:58 to connect to MCP servers and abstract away a lot of the lower
6:02 level networking and code.
6:03 You've also seen a list of many different MCP
6:06 compatible applications to get you up and running with different IDE's,
6:11 web applications, and client-side or desktop applications.
6:14 In the next section,
6:15 we'll dive a little bit deeper into building remote MCP servers.
6:19 See you then.
